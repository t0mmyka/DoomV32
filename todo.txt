1. Create skybox wall rendering function (add isSkybox to segment struct)

2. Create visual map editor functionality
	OPTIONS:
	a) Make the interface from scratch (learn low level graphics)
	b) Use prexisting gui library to create editor (fast and customizable)
	c) Use prexisting editor and convert/export using a script (fast and new)

3. Add transparent wall rendering
	Copy normal wall renderer but change the clipping updates

4. Create billboard rendering
	OPTIONS:
	a) Rewrite bsp rendering to pre pass and update the clipping first then
	use painter's algorithm to render billboards then render the segments
		May destroy performance, and takes a lot of work
	b) Render billboards column by column sorted by leaf
		Will have poor performance, and need to ensure render order is correct

5. Add map collision detection
	OPTIONS
	a) Recreate the block map
		true to the original, and bad in every way
	b) Use bsp to do collision checks
		true ish to the original, but better in most ways
		b1) Do sweaping line checks for objects (slow)
		b2) Use Minkowski addition for each unique object size (fast, needs prepocessing)
